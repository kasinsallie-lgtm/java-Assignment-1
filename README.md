The Mini Banking System is a console-based Java application designed to perform essential banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance enquiry, account search, and total bank balance calculation. The system is developed using Object-Oriented Programming principles including classes, objects, encapsulation, constructors, and method overloading.

The application also implements file handling using buffered streams to store and retrieve account information permanently. Exception handling is used to manage invalid inputs and transaction errors, ensuring system reliability. A minimum balance condition is maintained during withdrawal operations to prevent invalid transactions.

This project demonstrates the real-world application of Java programming concepts in building a structured and modular banking system.
